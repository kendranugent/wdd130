    <h2>Kendra Nugent</h2>
    <h2>I don't have any nicknames</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Laguna Beach, California with my parents and sister. I am working toward a fine art major with hopes of getting a minor in computer programing. I love to read, play video games, bake, paint, draw, and pretty much any other art medium you can think of. At the moment I have been doing a lot of embroidery. </p>
    <p> I am looking to become a prop designer or set designer. I want to create new environments and items to make the environment seem more cohesive. The for the past five months I worked as an attractions cast member at Disneyland where I spent my days at Autopia and Star Tours. That really helped me solidify my love for environment design and prop design. Disney does a very good job of making you feel submerged in your surroundings using little details.</p> 
    <p>I am a non member but I came to BYUI because I want to be surrounded by others that care about their education. I transfered from a community college and, despite this being my first semester here, am technically a sophomore. I am taking this class to better understand html, css, and the process of web development in general. I took a few coding classes in high school but didn't follow up and lost much of that knowledge.</p>
